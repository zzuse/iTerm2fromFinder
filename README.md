# iTerm2fromFinder
Alfred workflow which launch iTerm2 and change dir to the window Finder working on.

# Motivation

I was using Terminal to open Finder working on directory.  

But since I am using iTerm2 a lot, I decided to search on the internet about launch iTerm2 and 'cd $DIR' function script. I tried a lot, but none of them working perfect match my usecase.  

Also the iTerm2 officially anounce support python3 for launch iTerm2 in newly versions, but that depends on installing AppKit which I met a lot of errors.  

I prefer simple and old ways. So I tried ---- using Applescript and Bash to do that work.
